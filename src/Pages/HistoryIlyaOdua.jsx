                There is no river without a source, every river flows from a fountain, just as every tree was once a seed. Ilya Odua
                 was the mustard seed planted many decades ago, but today has become an oak in the Supreme Comradium.
                 <div className="shrine"></div>
                The Ilya prides itself in the promotion of African culture, love, harmonious co-existence and advocacy for peace
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                How it all began:
                The seed of kariability in Odua was first planted when the institution was established in the 1982/83 academic session as Obafemi 
                Awolowo University and scores of students were admitted. Just like the genesis of the club at the then Technical College, Ibadan 
                by the students of University of Ile-Ife (Now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun state, Nigeria).
                There were two sets of students that formed the nucleus of Odua at the beginning. There were those that were already members of 
                the Kegites club before their admission into the university and those that were initiated (transformated) after gaining admission.
                Among those that were already kutasis before the present ODUA were: <br/>
                <ul>
                  <li>1. Ayo Olofintila from Ilya Imade</li>
                  <li>2. Victor Jegede from Ilya Tractor</li>
                  <li>3. Lola Olajide from Ilya Olumo </li>
                  <li>4. Rotimi Adedayo from Ilya Fedeco⅔</li>
                  <li>5. Tope Ogunleye from Ilya Ondo</li>
                  <li>6. Bunmi Aborisade from Ilya Olosunta.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                Those that were transformed as comrads and joined to form the foundation members of then "baby Ilya Ewi" were people like:
                <ul>
                  <li>1. Kabiyesi Oba Charles Olajide Bale</li>
                  <li>2. Sunday Egunjobi</li>
                  <li>3. Akin Oluwadare</li>
                  <li>4. Oludare Ige</li>
                  <li>5. Olajide Awe</li>
                  <li>6. Jadesola Gbago</li>
                  <li>7. Seyi Dada</li>
                  <li>8. Abimbola Oni</li>
                  <li>9. Olajide Omojolomoju</li>
                  <li>10. Matthew Ajoloko</li>
                  <li>11. Taoreed Akinsanya</li>
                  <li>12. Ademola Adelugba</li>
                  <li>13. late Oba Tunde</li>
                  <li>14. Ogunsakin, Olurotimi </li>
                  <li>15. Daramola, Jide Borode</li>
                  <li>16. Dele Agbede</li>
                  <li>17. Tope Ige </li>
                  <li></li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                Every meaningful organization must have a head, Ayo Olofintila usually led the baby Ilya Ewi, as it was, 
                to gyrate at the Ajitadidun campus field for weekly mini-tapping every Thursday. 
                He was later appointed Co-ordinator by the AB Fedeco 82/83 Keg year, Chief Kehinde Adeboye.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                Becoming an Odua kuta those days was mentally rigorous, there was a thorough tutorial process where 
                the history, norms and values of the club were imparted, ditto the functions and responsibilities of members
                 and officers of the club. Instilling discipline as expected of a true African descent, advocating mutual love
                  and promoting respect for others.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                As a baby Ilya, migration to gyrations at different hemispheres was necessary for recognition and familiarization with the
                 norms and tenets of the club even as the baby Ilya members were being exposed to other people's culture through what could be termed as
                 tourism and adventure. The migration was also important, in the quest for a keg of office to become a full-fledged Ilya.
                 <br/>
                  (Picture of the Leg of office)
                  <br/>
                  The first shot at "keg of office" (autonomy) was in 1983/84 keg year at the World Headquarters during the reign of Chief Kola
                   Kazeem – Arakeke, while the late Chief Lati Oluti (aka Létua) was AB Fedeco, and with support from Fadasis like Chief Seyi 
                   Mekuleyi- of Ilya Imade, Chief Dada Afolayan-Emulewu of Olosunta, Chief Kehinde Adeboye of Fedeco. 
                </p>

                <br/>
                <p>
                However, in spite of acknowledged superlative performances at the TOK, comprising written and oral 
                tests of diverse kinds- (songis and drummis etc) Baby Ilya Ewi could not secure the keg of office that keg year.
                 Another invitation was sent in the following keg year 84/85 for another round of TOK. By providence,
                 Chief Arakeke had been posted to Ondo State University , Ado-Ekiti (OSUA) for his National Youth Service Corp 
                 (NYSC) scheme and became another mentor in the preparations.
                Although, due to coronation cataclyzm which led to Ilya Fedeco’s suspension, baby Ilya Ewi had to be absorbed 
                by Ilya Olosunta in order not to jeopardize our chances for a keg of office in that year. The second TOK was 
                tougher, but representatives were better positioned, tutored and prepared, accompanied by Chiefisis like Arakeke,
                 Kolà Akinlua, Seyi Mekuleyi and Chief Toyin aka Alabi Yellow, AB Olosunta 84/85 keg year.
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                The following year, the late Chief Emmanuel Abiodun Olorunfe-Ojo, aka Bishop was AB World then.
                 Chief Akinbayo Akinyemi Oshuntoye aka Kako Onikumo was our
                 ‘tormentor in-Chief’ but was very much impressed by the kariability displayed at the "test of kariability" (TOK). 
                </p>

                <br/>

                <p>
                Few weeks after, the results were announced. Behold, baby Ilya Ewi had become Ilya ODUA - a name taken from the
                 acronyms of the institution’s new nomenclature: Ondo State University Ado-Ekiti- ODUA!
                Painfully, it was during that keg year that comradium lost Chief Bishop the then AB World, who climbed the tallest 
                Kegites tree when attending a comradic function at Abraka, Delta State, while Hamzat Kayode, aka Baba Kay became the new AB World during 
                85/86 keg year.
                <br/>
                <div className="office"></div>
                <br/>
                </p>

                <br/>
                <p>
                Having fulfilled all the necessary requirements and a keg of office being issued, Ayodeji Olofintila, the first and only
                 co-ordinator of Baby Ilya Ewi was coronated as  the first AB chief of ilya Odua in the 1985/86 keg year. 
                Today he's popularity refered to as chief OLODU 1 of odua but contrary to this generally held belief, he was Chefe du Live Current, not Olodu!
                Live current was derived from the energy that powers the Ilya and gives strength that liven things up, but can shock any time T! Resonating 
                high coordination spirit and zero tolerance for social vices.
                </p>

                <br/>
                <p>
                Right from inception, Odua has been known for kariability, giving support to other Ilya6   
                and hemispheres especially during the yearly state to state world carnivals (now laid to rest). 
                Ilya Odua hosted the 1st World Carnival in 1987 during the reign of Chief Olúdáre Ige (Okada 1). Aside
                 the world carnival, Fellowsis Nite (an organized gyration, usually held on the eve of convocation ceremony 
                 where karid graduating comrads are promoted as Fellowsis, Senior Fellowsis and other revered personalities are equally
                  honoured), was another event which enabled kuta6 migrate either enmass or individually (via one-one leg).   Of course,
                   the usual transformation and coronation ceremonies 
                were basic events Odua had hosted and participated in, across ilyases within the country. 
                </p>

                <br/>
                <p>

                Much kudos to the generations that have kept the tradition of kariability going, up to this moment. May the labour of our
                heroes past not be in vain and unrewarded, both here, and in the hereafter. 
                Since the birth of the new Ilya ODUA, till present day, the Ilya has withnessed the reign and administration of several 
                chiefs who, in their own ways and capacities have contributed to the growth and sustainability strategy of the Ilya. 
                The Ilya has lots of important personalities, who supports with their resources. They are in various cadres within the 
                comradic rankings - chiefs,  Fellows, Senior Fellows (SF), Life Senior Fellows (LSF), Patrons, and Grand patrons (GP). 
                The Ilya also boasts of an ultramodern shrine (a gyration sanctuary within the institutions), 
                <br/>
                <div className="old-shrine"></div>
                
                <br/> 
                which has undergone several modifications and face-lift from onset. The first shrine was situated near the now faculty 
                of engineering around the space where the former school mosque was erected and "metamorphosed" to the present day site 
                where it appearance has also evolved with time, seasons and civilization - from palm front shed, to bamboo built hut,
                to Oregon sheer roofing and pole support to what we currently have.
                <br/>

                <div className="shrine"></div>
                <br/> 

                The Ilya also possess a personalized sound system for ease of comradic jollification within the Ilya.
                With the help of baba Eledumare, the all knowing and giver of all good things.

                The Ilya hope to have a bus to ease her daily movements and activities within comradic spheres.

                <div className="story">
                  <p>
                  This is a term used to usher in the officials of the club during a special function. It symbolises official opening of the ceremony 
                  just as it's done in orthodox churches. In comradium, the members lead entry in a file
                  followed by the chiefs.
                  </p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  The Chiefisis' Procession in the Comradium symbolizes the arrival of the "gods" into the "Centre of Gravity" 
                  of a gyration/functions, of the Club (The gods are not to Blame).
                  </p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  The Bearer of the Gorge at that moment of the Procession is the Tapper of the host Ilya which symbolises the arrival of Palmwine
                  (The Basis Of African Unity And World Peace) into the Gyration Ground - before then, 
                  Palmwine is usually "out of sight and out of touch" UNTIL after BLESSMATUA (pronouncement of blessings).
                  </p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  Only four (4) Comrads join the Procession Line with the Chiefisis, and these are, the Songito (in the lead/front,
                   with the Gong and rendering Procession Songis), a Marshall, the Tapper (bearing the Gorge), then followed by the Chiefisis, 
                   on a single file, and in the order of hierarchy (i.e. ABs, XYs, XYZ^ etc), until AB World Chief brings up the rear, with another
                   Marshall closing the line..this is the Orderliness and a reason why it is called Chiefisis Procession. 
                  </p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  Solemnity reigns during Procession (i.e. NO Keke must ke and NO Dun dun must dun), all Movements siezed, and a total embargo on all sounds, except
                   the voice and the gong of the leading songito, while kuta6 only ECOWAS (echoes) where and when allowed.
                  </p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  No draggings, no wobblings, as if possessed or under the influence of strange drinks or drugs, these acts constitute negative imports and perceptions
                   of the club activity and its overall integrity.
                  </p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  This is the order in comradium, and the club operates under strict adherence to the provisions of 
                  the written and unwritten constitutions and of course, known as "sealations".
                  </p>

                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  However, there are other processions known as 
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <strong>KEGWEEK PROCESSION:</strong> 
                  This is done to create awareness during the annual kegweek. It announces the end of a kegyear (session),  
                  and the preparation to select new officials for the coming kegyear. It is also a way of showing the beauty 
                  of the club and propagation of African culture to the comrado6 as the procession lasts round the school premises.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <strong>TRANSITIONAL PROCESSION:</strong>
                  This happens when a member climbs the tallest Bacchus tree, that is when a member has passed on.. 
                  It is regarded as the last respect for the departed. In this case the procession line is made up of all 
                  kariable entities and terminated by the chief.
